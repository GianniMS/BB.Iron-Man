# Button Clicker | CMGT Hogeschool Rotterdam 
This is the code for a simple button clicker game I made using Typescript. The first person to click the button five times wins. The winning side will have their flag raised on the device I made. I made this for my studies at CMGT Hogeschool Rotterdam.

Take a look!
